# Module 1: The Basics of Data
Data analytics is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision making. It is a compelling subject that transcends industry boundaries. Data analytics can be branched into two primary components: conceptual understanding of data (theoretical aspect) and hands-on manipulation of data (practical aspect). 

## Chapter 1: The Data Analyst
The ultimate role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization.

Key responsibilities and skills:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
   Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets, and external sources,
   Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

2. Data Analysis:
   Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques, or other analytic tools to interpret data,
   Identifying trends, patterns, and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

3. Data Visualization and Storytelling:
   Creating visual representations of the data, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to make complex information easily understandable,
   articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of the data to stakeholders.

4. Decision Support:
   Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions,
   Providing context around the data, including potential implications and future trends.

5. Collaboration and Communication:
   Working closely with other departments, such as marketing, finance, and operations, to understand their data needs and provide insights,
   Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders,

6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation: 

Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools, and technologies in data analysis.
Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.

Analytics is made possible by modern data, storage, and computing capabilities.
1. Data
2. Storage
3. Computing Power

**The analytics process**
The Analytics Process is Iterative. While we describe the steps of the analytics process as a series of sequential actions, it is more accurate to think of them as a set of interrelated actions that may be revisited frequently while working with a dataset.
1. Data Acquisition
2. Cleaning and Manipulation
3. Analysis
4. Visualization
5. Reporting and Communication

**Analytics Techniques**
Analysts use a variety of techniques to draw conclusions from the data at their disposal.
1. Descriptive Analytics
2. Predictive Analytics
3. Prescriptive Analytics

**Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning**
Data analytics is intellectually and computationally demanding therefore, you do not always have to do this work yourself; you can rely on automated techniques to help you unlock the hidden value in your data.
*Machine learning* uses algorithms to discover knowledge in your datasets that you can then apply to help you make informed decisions about the future. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI techniques. ML techniques attempt to apply statistics to data problems in an effort to discover new knowledge. 

*Artificial intelligence* (AI) includes any type of technique where you are attempting to get a computer system to imitate human behavior. As the name implies, you are trying to ask computer systems to artificially behave as if they were intelligent.

*Deep learning*is a further subdivision of machine learning that uses quite complex techniques, known as neural networks, to discover knowledge in a particular way. It is a highly specialized subfield of machine learning that is most commonly used for image, video, and sound analysis.
